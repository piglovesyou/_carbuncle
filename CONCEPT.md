Carbancle - Browser Testing Desktop App

- Concept
  - Stop maintaining all the Selenium stuff
    - Cost of browser testing is high
      - If a team took the cost, they hesitate to improve UI and that can discourage improving their app
      - Test cases should be easily created, modified and removed by various type of people
    - A thing we can provide by combining all Selenium technology is too flexible
      - What about an app that covers up 80% of usual cases with easy operation?
  - Why Selenium Builder / Selenium IDE generates "script"?
    - Which means that only programmers can make browser tests
      - There are always non-programmers who help web engineering in an office
      - Testing can be their post. They can be heroes
    - Generated script will be a burden
      - Script always has bugs which should be maintained
      - Script is the most flexible form
      - I think scripting is too much to operate webdriver in most cases
    - Mainpoint is to control webdrivers
      - Thankfully all webdrivers implements almost the same API
      - So storing "commands" and "parameters" will be just fine
        - Then we can cover up exceptional cases with using another way
      - We can encapsulate controlling selenium within our new wrapper software
  - Browser testing environment should provide more features
    - Managing test cases
      - Put tags on test cases and make them searchable
        - With using "#xx" formula
      - List/sort/filter test cases
    - Enable running all/multiple test cases from GUI and CUI
    - Sharing steps
      - Common steps like "Open user settings" 
    - Sharing locators
      - Locators should be shared and easily replaced to all selectors
      - It should be managed for each applications
    - Users/Groups
      - Who/When the test case is created/modified
- Archtecture
  - Idea 1
    - nw.js that controls chromedriver
    - When recording, nw.js launch google-chrome through chromedriver
      - Embed recording script in a browser
      - Send XHR when a user operates (click, input...)
    - When playbacking
      - Simply launch google-chrome and playback recorded steps
    - pros: Simple to operate chrome by nw.js through chromedriver
    - cons: Capturing user events is annoying
      - Sending XHR could cause complicated bug
      - Implementing is annoying
  - Idea 2
    - Node launch chromedriver
    - chromedriver launch nw.js
    - nw.js includes iframe
    - iframe contains a target website
    - When recording
      - Capturing events through `iframe.contentWindow.Document`
    - When playbacking
      - Control nw.js itself through chromedriver
  -  Persistence
    - I'm planning to use Mongodb only because I know it a bit
    - Database should be able to be shared from multiple clients
- Any reusable code?
  - In recording functionality, Selenium Builder depends on jQuery. I don't want jQuery. Also the source code is not so fascinating
  - I read Selenium Builder and Selenium IDE. It's likely that I should reuse a part that manages steps as data in Selenium Builder.
